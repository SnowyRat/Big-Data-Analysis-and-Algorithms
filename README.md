# Big-Data-Analysis-and-Algorithms
Python/Flask/PostgreSQL application for fetching data about places of interest and finding similar ones by both structured and unstructured data.

Given 4 cities find points of interests around them, this was done using OSM and Wikipedia.
Find similar places in different and same cities using KMeans and K-NearestNeighbors algorithms.
In this case a relevance rating was used as main criteria for the algorithms which consisted of wikipedia page views, revision count, image count, link count etc.
Extract images from each POI then, extract dominant colors from images as a vector.
Find similar places based on unstructured data, in this case the dominant colors.
Store the data in postgreSQL, which later was used for SQL quesries for the site.
